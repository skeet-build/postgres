# PostgreSQL

A Model Context Protocol server that provides read-only access to PostgreSQL databases. This server enables LLMs to inspect database schemas and execute read-only queries.

To learn more about MCP Servers see:
- [What is MCP](https://skeet.build/docs/guides/what-is-mcp)
- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

This PostgreSQL MCP Server was designed for seamless integration with [skeet.build](https://skeet.build)

## Components

### Tools

- **query**
  - Execute read-only SQL queries against the connected database
  - Input: `sql` (string): The SQL query to execute
  - All queries are executed within a READ ONLY transaction

### Resources

The server provides schema information for each table in the database:

- **Table Schemas** (`postgres://<host>/<table>/schema`)
  - JSON schema information for each table
  - Includes column names and data types
  - Automatically discovered from database metadata

## Usage with Claude Desktop

To use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@skeetbuild/postgres",
        "postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/mydb` with your database name.

## Usage with Cursor

To use this server with [Cursor](https://skeet.build/docs/apps/cursor#what-is-model-context-protocol), add the following configuration to your global (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) or project-specific (`.cursor/mcp.json`) configuration file:

### Global Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@skeetbuild/postgres",
        "postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For more details on setting up MCP with Cursor, see the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://skeet.build/docs/apps/cursor#what-is-model-context-protocol).

## Usage with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

To use this server with [GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://skeet.build/docs/apps/github-copilot), add a new MCP server using the VS Code command palette:

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` and search for "Add MCP Server"
2. Select "SSE MCP Server" and use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "postgres": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@skeetbuild/postgres",
          "postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [GitHub Copilot MCP documentation](https://skeet.build/docs/apps/github-copilot).

## Usage with Windsurf

To use this server with [Windsurf](https://skeet.build/docs/apps/windsurf), add the following configuration to your Windsurf MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
